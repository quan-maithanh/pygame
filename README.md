# pygame
I make some simple games by pygame just for fun, and also to practice my programming skill set :)

For Pygame installation, please refer at its website: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

I would be more than happy if you have any feedback to improve the game play, or to fix bugs!
